        <h1>About Bailey</h1>

        <p> Hello, my name is Bailey Lamm, and I was born on April 12, 2001, in Des Moines, Iowa. Growing up, I lived in Urbandale, a suburb just outside of Des Moines. 


            I am enrolled at the Tippie College of Business and am majoring in Finance and Business Analytics with a certificate in Risk Management and Insurance.

            
            Now, I am preparing to graduate in May. I am excited to start my career in the insurance industry, and I have accepted a position in Business Development at Innovative Captive Strategies.

            
            As I reflect on my academic journey, I am proud of my accomplishments and the hard work I have put in to get where I am today. I created this portfolio to highlight both my personal and academic achievements, and to showcase my passion for finance and insurance.
            
            Thank you for taking the time to learn a little bit about me, and I look forward to what the future holds.

        </p>
